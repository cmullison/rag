# cloudflare-retrieval-augmented-generation-example

This repo shows how to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Cloudflare Workers AI. It uses Cloudflare Workflows, D1, and Vectorize to store notes that can be used to generate context for the RAG model. You can then use Cloudflare AI's Llama-based models, or Anthropic Claude to generate responses.

This project was created as part of a tutorial on [Building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Application with Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/tutorials/build-a-retrieval-augmented-generation-ai/). If you want a guided walkthrough of the steps in this repo, check out the tutorial.

## Installation/Setup

You must have a Cloudflare account and the `wrangler` CLI installed (or use `npx wrangler`).

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-retrieval-augmented-generation-example.git
$ cd cloudflare-retrieval-augmented-generation-example
$ npm install
```

Generate a new database and vector index:

```bash
$ wrangler d1 create DATABASE
$ wrangler vectorize create docs-rag-index --preset "@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5"
```

Apply the migration to create the `notes` table in D1:

```bash
$ wrangler d1 migrations apply DATABASE

# Apply in production
$ wrangler d1 migrations apply DATABASE --remote
```

Add the configuration to `wrangler.toml`, replacing my values with your own:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DATABASE"
database_name = "<your database name>"
database_id = "<your database id>"

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTOR_INDEX"
index_name = "<your vector index name>"
```

Deploy the application:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

## Usage

After deploying, you can use the following routes:

- `/` is an endpoint that accepts a `?text` query param and returns a response from the model.
- `/ui` is a form UI that allows you to ask the AI a question and get a response.
- `/write` is a form UI that allows you to add a note to the AI's knowledge base.
- `/notes` is a list of all the notes in the AI's knowledge base.
- `/notes.json` is a JSON endpoint that returns all the notes in the AI's knowledge base.

### Changing the model

If you would like to use Anthropic Claude instead of Workers AI, set the secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your Workers application:

```bash
$ wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY your-api-key
```

Once you've set this secret, all text generation will be done by Claude.

### Recursive text splitting

By default, this app uses Langchain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split text into chunks. This is a recommended approach for taking large pieces of text and formatting them for RAG use-cases. You can turn this off by setting the `ENABLE_TEXT_SPLITTER` variable in `wrangler.toml` to `false`:

```toml
[vars]
ENABLE_TEXT_SPLITTER = "false"
```
